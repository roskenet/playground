<literallayout>SUMMARY:
It is 2000 B.C. in Egypt and Imhotep the Ka-Priest brings home his beautiful young concubine Nofret. However not all the members of his family welcome her and when she is found dead it is Imhotepâ€™s daughter Renisenb who suspects it might not have been an accident.</literallayout>
<para>
  This death unleashes the greed and hate that have been building up
  within the family and the horrific events that follow tear it apart.
  With few allies she can confide in, even Renisenb has to constantly
  look over her shoulder.

  <emphasis role="strong">The action of this book takes place on the

  <emphasis role="strong">bequeathed to the ka-priest, in return for
  which he was expected to</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">maintain
  the tomb of the testator, and to provide offerings at the

  <emphasis role="strong">peasant life, and with the addition of five
  intercalary days at the end of</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">the
  year was used as the official calendar of 365 days to the year.
  This</emphasis>

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">&quot;year&quot; originally began with the
  arrival in Egypt of the flood-water of</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">the Nile in the third week of July by our
  reckoning. The absence of a</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">leap
  year caused this to lag through the centuries, so that at the
  time</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">of our story, the official New
  Year's Day fell about six months earlier</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">than the opening of the agricultural year,
  i.e., in January instead of</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">July.

  dates here used as chapter headings are</emphasis>

  seemed quieter and</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">boasted less.
  Ipy was less impudent and offhand with his elder</emphasis>

  over-hot iron - some dyestuff</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">was
  spilt over another. Sometimes sharp thorns found their way

  did - which means that</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">he saw a

  Renisenb! From that distance it might have been anyone
  wearing</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">a woman's dress and a wig.
  Hush - let me go on. The other possibility is</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">that the boy is lying. He told a tale that he
  had been taught to tell. He</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">was

  have been set aside for Yahmose's</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">children, but the administration of it would
  have been in their hands - in</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">Sobek's hands in particular. Sobek would
  undoubtedly have been the</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">greatest
  gainer. He would presumably have functioned as ka-priest</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">during Imhotep's absences and would succeed to
  that office after</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">Imhotep's death.
  But though Sobek benefited, yet Sobek cannot be the</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">guilty person, since he himself drank of the
  poisoned wine so heartily</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">that he
  died. Therefore, as far as I can see, the deaths of these two

  <emphasis role="strong">&quot;Yes, and that is one reason, Renisenb,
  why I came to suspect. For the</emphasis>

  get relief. But Yahmose</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">has always
  been timid, easily ruled, and with never enough courage to</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">rebel. He loved Imhotep and worked hard to
  please him, and Imhotep</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">found him
  well-meaning but stupid and slow. He despised him. Satipy,</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">too, treated Yahmose with all the scorn of a
  bullying nature. Slowly his</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">burden
  of resentment, concealed but deeply felt, grew heavier. The</emphasis>

  at last to reap the reward of</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">his

  his</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">father, Nofret came. It was
  Nofret, and perhaps Nofret's beauty, that</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">kindled the final spark. She attacked the
  manhood of all three</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">brothers. She
  touched Sobek on the raw by her scorn of him as a fool,</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">she infuriated Ipy by treating him as a
  truculent child without any claim</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">to manhood, and she showed Yahmose that he was
  something less</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">than a man in her
  eyes. It was after Nofret came that Satipy's tongue</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">finally goaded Yahmose beyond endurance. It
  was her jeers, her taunt</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">that she
  was a better man than he, that finally sapped his

  <emphasis role="strong">&quot;Yes, for the last hour. But do you not

  You thought she had fallen</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">a few
  moments before - but that was impossible. She had been dead
  at</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">least two hours; otherwise, in
  that hot sun, her face could never have</emphasis>

  fairly soon convinced that the person she feared was
  Yahmose.</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">She stopped bullying him
  and instead was eager to obey him in every</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">way. It had been, you see, a terrible shock to
  her. Yahmose, whom she</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">despised as
  the meekest of men, had actually been the one to kill</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">Nofret. It turned Satipy's world upside down.
  Like most bullying</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">women, she was a
  coward. This new Yahmose terrified her. In her fear</emphasis>

  Satipy saw that caused her to</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">fall.
  She saw what you saw today. She saw in the face of the man</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">following her - her own husband - the
  intention to throw her down as he</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">had thrown that other woman. In her fear she
  backed away from him</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">and fell. And

<para>
  <emphasis role="strong"></emphasis>
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">&quot;Esa came on the truth because of an
  entirely irrelevant remark made</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">by
  Henet. Henet complained that I did not look at her, but as though
  I</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">saw something behind her that was
  not there. She went on to speak of</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">Satipy. In a flash Esa saw how much simpler
  the whole thing was than</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">we had
  thought. Satipy did not look at something behind Yahmose -
  it</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">was Yahmose himself she saw. To
  test her idea, Esa introduced the</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">subject in a rambling way which could mean
  nothing to anyone except</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">Yahmose
  himself - and only to him if what she suspected was true.
  Her</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">words surprised him and he
  reacted to them just for a moment,</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">sufficiently for her to know that what she
  suspected was the truth. But</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">Yahmose knew then that she did suspect. And
  once a suspicion had</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">arisen, things
  would fit in too well, even to the story the herd boy told
  -</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">a boy devoted to him who would do
  anything his Lord Yahmose</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">commanded

  <emphasis role="strong">that he would not wake

  these other killings!&quot;</emphasis>
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong"></emphasis>
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">&quot;It is difficult to explain to you,
  Renisenb, but once the heart is opened</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">to evil - evil blossoms like poppies amongst
  the corn. All his life</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">Yahmose had
  had, perhaps, a longing for violence and had been</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">unable to achieve it. He despised his own
  meek, submissive role. I</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">think that
  the killing of Nofret gave him a great sense of power. He</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">realized it first by Satipy. Satipy, who had
  browbeaten and abused him,</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">was now
  meek and terrified. All the grievances that had laid buried
  in</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">his heart so long reared their
  heads - as that snake reared up on the</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">path here one day. Sobek and Ipy were, one
  handsomer, the other</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">cleverer than
  he - so they must go. He, Yahmose, was to be the ruler of</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">the house, and his father's only comfort and
  stay! Satipy's death</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">increased the
  actual pleasure of killing. He felt more powerful as a</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">result of it. It was after that that his mind
  began to give way - from then</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">on
  evil possessed him utterly.</emphasis>
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong"></emphasis>
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis role="strong">&quot;You, Renisenb, were not a rival. So far
  as he still could he loved you.</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">But
  the idea that your husband should share with him in the estate
  was</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">not one to be borne. I think
  Esa agreed to the idea of accepting Kameni</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">with two ideas in her head - the first that if
  Yahmose struck again, it</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">would be
  more likely to be at Kameni than at you - and in any case
  she</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">trusted me to see that you were
  kept safe. The second idea - for Esa</emphasis>
  <emphasis role="strong">was a bold woman - was to bring things to a
  head. Yahmose, watched</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">by me - whom
  he did not know suspected him - would be caught in the</emphasis>
