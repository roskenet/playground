## Topic 8: The Essence of Good Design 

ETC principle: Easier to Change

## Topic 9: DRY - The Evils of Duplication

Maintenance is not only fixing bugs and enhancing features. Software and the developers should always be in maintenance mode.

"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

Avoid duplication!

Not All Code Duplication Is Knowledge Duplication: Example with validation of age and quantity of ordered items. 
x > 0 is coincidently the same.

DRY in data classes: point x, point y, (length z)

Make it easy to reuse code!

Don’t rely on the properties of things you can’t control.
