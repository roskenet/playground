       From the previous chapter, we hope we have now convinced you that a lot of good things come from limiting your work in process
         (WIP). By now youâre probably full of questions: What is the right limit for you? How do you go about finding the WIP limit?
         Are there some good starting points that can guide you?

       As you soon will find, there are no hard rules here. Finding a suitable WIP limit is not only contextual and dependent on
         what you want to achieve, but also like hitting a moving target. The WIP limits can and should change. At the outset of this
         chapter, we can already reveal a secret:
       <i class="calibre6">
        the goal is not to limit WIP
       </i>
       . WIP limits are only a means to drive you to improve. Improve to achieve a better flow, which is the theme of the next chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Thatâs why youâll see a lot of âIt dependsâ and âYou can do this, that, or the otherâ in this chapter. Itâs not a sign of
         us not knowing; itâs that you need to find what works best for you and your team.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       No need to worry, though; we have packed this chapter full of guidance and principles for finding a suitable WIP limit, as
         well as practical ways many teams go about visualizing and setting their WIP limits. Letâs dive in and see how you can reason
         your way to finding a WIP limit for your team.

       6.1. The search for WIP limits
      </h3>
      <p class="noind">
       Searching for a suitable WIP limit for your team can be tricky business. What is right for you and your team right now? The
         answer is the old-favorite answer of consultants worldwide: âIt depends.â
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       And it does. It depends on

      <p class="calibre16">
      </p>
      <ul class="calibre17">
       <li class="calibre18">
        How much pressure there is to continuously improve the organization
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        The number of people on the team and their availability
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        The shape and size of the work items youâre working with
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="noind">
       And the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       To find a WIP limit for your team, here are few basic rules of thumb, but be prepared to change the WIP limits as you learn
         more:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre16">
      </p>
      <ul class="calibre17">

        Lower is better than higher.

        No limits is not the answer.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="noind">
       Letâs examine these approaches in detail.

       Lower is better than higher
      </h4>
      <p class="noind">
       A lower WIP limit is generally better than a higher one because you want to limit the number of items you work on as much
         as possible. This will give you better lead times and faster feedback and force you to remove impediments. These are all things
         that help you improve the flow of work items in your process.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Setting the WIP limit
       <i class="calibre6">
        too
       </i>
       low, however, could make your process come to a grinding halt, because it will quickly bring out any problems in the process.
         Imagine that your entire team is working on a single work item, and all of a sudden you need an answer from a customer in
         order to continue. Because that work item is the only thing you were doing, you have come to a complete stop.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Problems are symptoms of things that will have to be changed in your process to improve your flow. Finding many problems can
         quickly become a painful experience

       for teams that arenât equipped to handle a lot of issues like these at once. Instead of feeling encouraged to improve and
         solve their problems, a common reaction is to give up and stop caring that theyâre breaking the WIP limit on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       You want to search for a low WIP limit, but not too low. There are signals to guide you, as youâll see in the next section.

       Tuning the WIP limit can easily become something that is talked about forever: striving to find the one true limit can result
         in a lot of discussions in which no one is able to decide what is best. This isnât time well spent; itâs better to try something
         and then adjust.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       A simple method to help you adjust the WIP limit up or down is the following:

       If your

       . There will be work items that no one is responsible for. This might be a good time to lower the WIP limit.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       With a
       <i class="calibre6">
        WIP limit that is too low, people will become idle

       . All items are being worked on, and there are people without work. You can now collaborate to get items done or raise the
         WIP limit.

       No limits is not the answer
      </h4>
      <p class="noind">
       Be sure not to fall into the trap of not setting a WIP limit at all! This is one of the most common mistakes we see in teams
         starting with kanban. Kanban involves three simple principles; donât remove one of them too soon.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       The risk is that youâll end up with a board flooded with work, as you see in the figure to the right, showing your inefficiencies
         and your failure to move work through your process. Eventually, the board will end up not being used, because you canât see
         the work items for all the work on the board.

      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Also, as weâll discuss further in
       <a class="calibre4" href="kindle_split_018.html#ch07">
        chapter 7
       </a>
       , removing the WIP limit will remove your incentive to improve. With no WIP limit, nothing pushes people to do better. If
         you allow an unlimited number of items on your board, nothing will force you to complete the ones on there before starting
         new work.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       This is because (if you remember from
       <a class="calibre4" href="kindle_split_016.html#ch05">
        chapter 5
       </a>
       about work in process) the more stuff you have going on at the same time, the longer the lead time will be for all the work
         in your process. You want a constraint that pushes you toward finishing work and toward improvements in your process. Weâll
         dive much deeper into this in

       6.2. Principles for setting limits
      </h3>
      <p class="noind">
       Finding your WIP limit depends on your context and particular situation. In this section, weâll take a look at some common
         ways that teams weâve coached and heard about have agreed on their limits.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Remember that itâs not so much about finding
       <i class="calibre6">
        the
       </i>
       WIP limit, but rather, visualizing your current WIP limit; itâs the best so far. You
       <i class="calibre6">
        should
       </i>
       change it as often as needed. Embrace change; itâs good for you.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       As always, use the examples here as inspiration, and expand on them to suit your needs. Letâs start with a simple principle,
         one that might already be stuck in your head from previous chapters: stop starting, start finishing.
      </p>
      <h4 class="calibre28" id="ch06lev2sec4">
       6.2.1.
       <a class="calibre4" id="ch06lev2sec4__title">
       </a>
       Stop starting, start finishing
      </h4>
      <p class="noind">
       A simple yet powerful starting point to limit your work in process is agreeing to
       <i class="calibre6">
        strive to complete current work before starting anything new
       </i>
       . This will keep your WIP low, because you only start new work when something else is finished.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       An easy way to begin doing this is to adopt this slogan for your team:
      </p>
      <p class="center1">

      <p class="noind">
       Yes, you have to think hard when saying it the first few times, but then it sticks. A good idea might be to put this statement
         above your board, where youâll meet each morning; or why not use it as the opening or closing phrase of your daily standups?

        roll-call ending. As people leave the standup, say:

        âAnd letâs be careful out there.â
       </p>

        By using a reference to
        <i class="calibre6">
         Hill Street Blues

        , we have probably dated ourselves pretty well. It was a police series in the 1980s that was a big hit in Sweden. Every person
            who has seen it remembers the ending of the morning roll calls at the police station; everyone rose, and the sergeant called
            out, âOne more thing ... letâs be careful out there.â

      <p class="noind">
       There is great power in this simple slogan, because it pushes you to a lower WIP. It also sums up a basic pattern of kanban:
         to prefer to finish work before starting something new. Doing so will help you not only to limit the number of work items
         you work on at the same time, but also to shorten lead times, take work through the whole value chain, get feedback, and improve
         your process.
      </p>

       Letâs finish this section with an inspirational quote to help you remember whatâs important:

       <a class="calibre4" href="kindle_split_018.html#ch07">
        chapter 7
       </a>
       ), but setting it too low will probably be too disruptive for your flow. For example, if you have a WIP limit of one, any
         disturbance in the flowâsuch as handoffs, people out of the office, and so onâwill cause all work to stop. Most organizations
         arenât ready to handle all those improvement opportunities (you remember thatâs what we call problems, right?) at once, so
         you probably should go with a WIP limit higher than one item.

        Mob programming is an interesting and novel approach to system development pioneered by a team coached by Woody Zuill. The
            basic concept of mob programming is simple: the entire team works as a team together on one task at a time. That means: one
            team, one (active) keyboard, one screen (projector of course). Itâs just like doing full-team pair programming.
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        A team doing mob programming has a WIP limit of one. Thatâs very effective when it comes to completing the work being worked
            on as fast as possible. Any question, any problem, will be tackled immediately; and all the people needed to solve the problem
            are present in the room and have time to solve any issues right away.
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        But this approach is very inefficient when it comes to utilizing the people on the team to the fullest. Not every person on
            the team is actively typing code.
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        The question is, are you selling keystrokes or completed features?
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        For many organizations, mob programming is too extreme; a WIP limit of one is probably not suitable for everyone. But for
            the organizations that can handle it, work flows very fast indeed.

       Summing up this section on guidance for setting your WIP limits, we can say that in most cases, setting the WIP limit to one
         isnât a good idea. You should strive for a low number, but not necessarily one.

       Remember that there is no true WIP limit to be found. WIP limits are tools that you use to improve. You might ask questions
         like âWill this WIP limit help our work to flow better or make our flow worse? Will this WIP limit render a lot of people
         idle? Will a lot of work be idle? Is that a problem, and what can we do to resolve it?â

       Take one! Take two!
      </h4>
      <p class="noind">
       Many teams that we have coached have gone through a similar journey to reach a suitable WIP limit. Their experience illustrates
         the kind of reasoning that we think is necessary concerning WIP limits, and we want to relate that reasoning here. Learn from
         this, and then pick a limit that suits you.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Letâs assume you have a five-person team. You could, for example, start out boldly and decide on a WIP limit of one per person,
         making the total WIP limit equal to the number of people on the team.
      </p>
      <p class="center1">
       <img alt="" class="calibre2" height="118" src="./115fig01.jpg" width="500"/>
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Pretty soon, youâll find out that this approach creates some problems; if you become blocked, you canât pick up new work without
         breaking the WIP limit, for example. You may decide it seems more reasonable to allow for a maximum of
       <i class="calibre6">
        two
       </i>
       items each, so people have something to do if one item is blocked. That makes the total WIP limit equal to the team size
         times two.
      </p>
      <p class="center1">
       <img alt="" class="calibre2" height="120" src="./115fig02.jpg" width="500"/>
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       But that setup might not be reasonable either, because it allows for situations in which every person on the team can be blocked
         on one item and still keep working on another without breaking the WIP limit. Thatâs a perfectly valid situation with a WIP
         limit setup like that, but in many instances this isnât pushing the team enough. You

      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       To push the team, you can back off from a WIP limit of 10 items and decide on maybe 8. If all team members are now blocked
         on one item, youâll start to break the WIP limit if everyone picks up another one to work with. You get a gentle nudge to
         do something about the blockage, because you exceed the WIP limit earlier with 8 items than you would with 10 items. If you
         want to get this warning even earlier, lower the WIP limit a bit more.

         right WIP limit that can be calculated. You must find the one that suits your team and your situation the best. The most rational
         thing is to try a WIP limit and then change it as needed.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Also, think about what kind of behavior you want the WIP limit to drive. Itâs the mechanism that drives improvements.

      <p class="noind">
       The previous section allowed every person to have at least one item going on at the same time. If your team is using collaboration
         practices like pair programming, you should probably lower the WIP limit even more. In such cases, you could set the WIP limit
         to a number lower than the number of people in the team. You could take the number of people on the team
       <i class="calibre6">
        divided
       </i>
       by 1.5 (or some other number you see fit) to yield a low WIP limit.

      <p class="noind">
       For our example five-person team, this will add up to roughly three items total to work on.

       With a WIP limit of three for a five-person team, people will quickly end up with nothing to do, if everyone works alone.
         To be able to handle a WIP limit of three and still engage people in the process, the team members will have to cooperate
         on items to

       finish them by using pair programming, writing the specifications together, or testing in pairs: exactly the kind of collaboration
         that agile teams seek. As a nice side effect, the work items will move fast across the board.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       This might be a big change for some teams that arenât used to collaborating closely. As always, donât set the WIP limit too
         low to start, but rather lower it little by little and improve your process at the same time.

       He proposed that you first observe what a normal level is in an unconstrained system. That means: what is the normal load

         is.

       Then double that amount of WIP and use that number as the limit, allowing for twice as much WIP as you have normally. You
         double the WIP limit because it can be statistically deduced that with normal variation, almost no teams will reach the limit.
         Itâs safe to say that this limit will have no effect at all to start withâeveryone should be able to pull it off. From this
         new limit, you can then incrementally go down by 20â30% decrementsâsay, every month or every two weeksâuntil you start to
         experience problems, queues build up, or you see people idle between tasks.

      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Letâs see this in practice. Say that a team usually has roughly four to five items going on at once. Following Mr. Reinertsenâs
         reasoning, you should start by allowing for 10 items on the board. You then back off that number by 20% at regular intervals.
         The first iteration youâre down to 8 items, and then 6, and then 5, and so on.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       As you do this, youâre not only lowering the WIP limit, which will flow items through your system faster. Youâre also starting
         a trend of continuous striving to improve: a mindset that characterizes Lean thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       This approach puts the focus on an important aspect of WIP limits; theyâre cheap to implement. You pick the number and donât
         take on more work than that. If that doesnât work out for you, if too many work items are idle, you can go back up to the
         level you had before. This makes WIP limits excellent for use in experiments.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       What happens if you lower the limit by 20%? Try it and see; if it doesnât work out, go back and think about what happened.
         What would you have to do differently to be able to lower the WIP and still keep items flowing through your system?
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       This approach teaches the team to continuously evaluate the limit to improve the flow. Because the initial WIP limit is high,
         decreasing it the first couple of times wonât cause any big problems. This helps the team get into the habit of evaluating
         and changing their limits regularly.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Although we used a whole-team WIP limit approach in this example, it makes perfect sense to apply the same thinking with a
         column-based WIP limit approach (as discussed in
       <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06lev1sec4">
        section 6.4

       Until now we have considered WIP limits for the whole board and whole team. Doing this, you donât concern yourself with how
         the work is distributed among the steps in your workflow (the columns on your board). Setting one single WIP limit, like the
         examples weâve considered up to now, is sometimes referred to as a system with a constant WIP (also known as CONWIP).

       6.4. Limiting WIP based on columns

      <p class="noind">
       Most teams that we have worked with set WIP limits per column instead of for the entire team. This gives them a bit more fine-grained
         control over how their work flows and an opportunity to handle bottlenecks and uneven flow. That said, setting a WIP for the
         entire board could still be useful and, if you donât know where to start, provides a good starting point.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       In this section, weâll dive deeper into common ways of limiting WIP per column, some things to consider when doing so, and

       Start from the bottleneck
      </h4>
      <p class="noind">
       All workflows always have a bottleneck somewhere, which sets the pace for the entire workflow. Increasing throughput upstream
         from the bottleneck will just pile up work in a queue in front of it, and trying to increase throughput downstream from the
         bottleneck is futile because there wonât be enough input to work on. If you can identify the bottleneck in your workflow,
         it makes sense to use WIP limits to help resolve it. For more on bottlenecks and how to discover and manage them, see
       <a class="calibre4" href="kindle_split_018.html#ch07lev1sec5">

       .
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Letâs look at an example, in the board to the right. Here we have a workflow where work items are piling up in a queue in
         front of a bottleneck: the Test column. If you do nothing, work will keep piling up, and WIP and lead times will increase.
         If you instead put a WIP limit of, say, 3 on the whole Development column, the developers will have to stop doing Development
         work when the queue starts to build. What should they do instead? They could help the testers finish their work. Whatever
         they do, they shouldnât pull in new work, because that will only build more WIP.

       As you can see, putting a WIP limit on the step feeding the bottleneck will stop the bottleneck from being flooded and drive

       Why did you buy this book? What is the reason you think kanban will help you improve? Most teams already have a pretty good
         idea about where (some of) their problems lie. A common scenario is to use kanban in order to collaborate together on fewer
         work items in order to complete them faster. In a team of mostly developers, it might make sense to put a challenging WIP
         limit on the Development column, where most of the active work is being done, in order to drive collaboration.

       </a>
       and distribute numbers over different columns. You can also apply the total to just one column: for example, putting 1.5
         times the number of developers as a WIP limit on the Development column.

      <p class="noind">
       There are as many ways to limit WIP as there are teams in the world, but weâll mention one that sometimes comes up as a question:
         can you limit your work in process based on estimated size of the work itemâfor example, by using
       <i class="calibre6">
        story points
       </i>
       ?

       (You can read more about story points in

        </sup>
        Story points are a way to estimate effort for a team, using relative measures; theyâre used in many agile methods such as
            Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="noind">
       As weâve said, youâll probably have to experiment to find a WIP limit that is suitable for your team. Start with your gut
         feeling and adjust the limit up or down, as described in
       <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06lev1sec1">
        section 6.1
       </a>
       . This goes for estimated effort size of your work item (for example, in story points) as well as for work items. Many teams
         using Scrum do this already, because when theyâre planning their next iteration, they look at how many story points they typically
         finish and pull that amount of new work into the iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Limiting WIP by estimated size means you only pull new work as long as it keeps you under an agreed-on limit: for example,
         under 10 story points. The next figure shows an example of a simple board where the developers have a WIP limit of 10 story
         points.

      <p class="noind">
       This WIP-limiting approach is often more suitable to decide per column, rather than for an entire team, because the size of
         a work item may change the more you work with it. For example, when you start analyzing an item, you might find that it will
         take less effort to implement than you first anticipated.

       Column-based WIP limits are often visualized by drawing them above each column of the board. But variants of this are plentiful.

       Some things weâve seen while working with teams are as follows:

      <ul class="calibre17">

         </i>
         â
        </b>
        This will make it apparent when you break the limit, because you have to put your work item outside of a box or on top of
            another work item.
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        <b class="calibre22">

         </i>
         â
        </b>
        This is similar to the drawn boxes and is also a good visual indicator that helps you to keep track of how youâre doing against
            the established WIP limit.

       Some teams might have a situation where people take work from start to finish, and itâs not common or feasible to hand over
         the work to someone else. The workflow can still be a sequence of steps that the work goes through. In fact, this can be valuable
         to show what state the work is in right now, even though the same person is doing the work throughout the process.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       A typical example of a team like this is in first-line support, in which you get a case from a customer in dire straits and
         you stay on it until itâs solved. Such a case might go through the following phases: finding a workaround for the customer,
         filing a bug, testing a new release of the system with the bug fix, and finally closing the case. All these stages are probably
         handled by a single person on a support team.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       This calls for another strategy: some teams choose to limit the number of work items for each person. You focus not so much
         on optimizing for flow through the workflow, but rather on ensuring that no one takes on too much work and that everyone has
         things to do.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Another situation where limiting WIP per person is suitable is for fighting multitasking on all levels in the team. In this
         case, a WIP limit per person can help visualize that some people are involved in many work items,

       which might be a driver behind the whole team having too much WIP. You can have conversations about how to prevent that,
         with a limit per person made explicit.

       If youâre using avatars to indicate who is working on what, a simple measure is to limit the number of avatars each person
         can have âin playâ at the same time. You could, for example, print three avatars for each person, effectively setting the
         WIP limit per person to three. Now itâs easy to see whoâs doing what and how many items each person is working with right
         now.

        Poor Sean, he had too few avatars
       </b>
       <p class="noind">
        On one team that Marcus coached, there was this guy: letâs call him Sean. Sean had been involved with this application since
            before you were born. He practically built it himself. Every decision was in one way or another routed through him. You have
            probably met Sean a couple of times, or at least his type of person.
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        This slowed the team down considerably, because the team was quite big (eight people) and every work item had to be routed
            through Sean in order to be completed. When we created the kanban system, we printed only three avatars per team member to
            put a finger on this pain point.
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        And indeed, the first morning meeting took about 35 minutes, most of them spent waiting for Sean to place the three (âOnly
            three? Can I have five more? Please?â) stickies with what he should work on during the day.
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        After letting him sweat for a while, we had a discussion about the problems this situation caused for the team and the flow
            of items. To Seanâs big surprise, it turned out that when he was on vacation or was sick, the team still got stuff out the
            door.
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        Maybe there were work items in which Sean didnât have to be involved? Maybe not having Sean involved in everything could increase
            the feeling of autonomy and mastery for other people on the team? Maybe that could free up Seanâs time to do the complex stuff
            that he, in fact, was the only one on the team who knew?
       </p>
       <p class="noind">
        It all ended well, but it was a bit shocking to poor Sean at first.

       Another common way to limit WIP per person is to give each person a swim lane through the process. Then you can decide on

       Work items or tasksâwhat are you limiting?
      </h4>
      <p class="noind">
       Quite often, teams split up work items into tasks for certain steps in their workflow. For Development, it could be tasks
         like âimplement data access,â âwrite HTML page,â and âcomplete business logic.â In a Testing column, they could be tasks like
         âprepare test data,â âwrite report,â and âperform manual tests.â Tasks are part of a work item and can be thought of as all
         the things you need to do to complete the work item in a given column.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Not until every task is completed in Development are the work items moved to the next step of the workflow. Some teams even
         divide the columns into subcolumns, forming a mini-board for the tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Here you can see two work items going on (one in each row), and each work item has been split up into several tasks. The team
         counts the WIP limit against the work item, not the tasks that compose the work item.
      </p>
      <p class="center1">

      <p class="noind">
       Most teams seem to work this way, counting their WIP limits against the work items. The tasks are only for tracking what you
         need to do in order to complete the work item and often arenât delivering customer value. It doesnât really matter how fast
         they flow across the board, if the customers still have to wait for anything useful to be delivered.

       There could be times when, in certain columns, you might want to limit the number of tasks. For example, you may want to limit
         the level of multitasking or make sure youâre always cooperating on certain tasks.

       In the figure at right, you can see a WIP limit of 4 for the Development column. The column is then split into two sections:
         Doing and Done. The developers are working on one item and have three items completed, which keeps them at their WIP limit.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Another way of visualizing this queue could be to have a Ready to Test queue column in the Test column instead. That would
         then count against the WIP limit of the testing step.
      </p>
      <p class="center1">
       <img alt="" class="calibre2" height="317" src="./127fig01.jpg" width="307"/>
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       How you visualize this on your team depends on what you want to achieve: that is, on who should âownâ the tickets that wait
         to be tested. Does it help the team if the developers get the signal in their area, or is it more useful for the testers to
         count the items in the queue against their WIP limit? The choice is something that needs to be discussed with the team, but
         the practical function of the queue column is the same in either case: items stuck there will stall and hinder the flow, and
         people canât pull new work into columns before the queue. With this setup, you can easily see which items are done and which
         items the developers are still working on.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       Finally, if you remember, back in
       <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06lev2sec10">
        section 6.4.1
       </a>
       we showed another way of doing this, where the queue column is a column by itself with its own WIP limit, as shown at right.
         In this case, the column has a WIP limit of its own, and itâs not counted against anyoneâs limit. Maybe this is another technique
         that can help your team. The limit doesnât âstealâ capacity from âyourâ column, but, again, the function of the queue is the
         same.
      </p>
      <p class="center1">
       <img alt="" class="calibre2" height="276" src="./127fig02.jpg" width="415"/>
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       That way of visualizing the queue prevents the bottleneck that the single tester has become. A buffer is built before him
         to make sure he doesnât get flooded and yet always has work to do, which he can pick from the buffer (the testing queue) in
         front of him.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       There are times when a queue should be counted against the WIP limit or even
       <i class="calibre6">
        is
       </i>
       the WIP limit itself (as in
       <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06lev2sec10">
        section 6.4.1
       </a>
       with the standalone queue column, for example). At other times, the distinction made between a queue and an
       <i class="calibre6">
        execution column
       </i>
       is a way to visualize detailed steps.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       The answer to this sectionâs question, âShould we count queues against the WIP limit?â is also, âIt depends.â For example,
         letâs say you have noticed that testing is a bottleneck.
       <sup class="calibre19">
        [
        <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06fn04">
         4
        </a>
        ]
       </sup>
       A queue might be a great way to ensure that the tester always has work that is ready to test. A WIP limit on the queue helps
         you make sure the queue doesnât get too long. With a WIP limit in place, you wonât be able to flood the queue with work without
         breaking the WIP limit. When you see a queue filled to its WIP limit, itâs time to discuss how to clear the blockage that
         is building up.

        Discovering and managing bottlenecks deserves a complete book on its own. But briefly, you might have a bottleneck if you
            see work accumulated before the bottleneck and if steps after the bottleneck are starved for work.

       6.7. Exercise: WIP it, WIP it real good
      </h3>
      <p class="noind">
       The time has come for you to start discussing WIP limits. Again, this should be a team effort. Remember that thereâs no optimal
         WIP limit for your team; itâs a tool that you can use to help you improve your work.
      </p>
      <p class="noind">
       If you donât have an obvious WIP limit that you can come up with, first discuss the points in
       <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06lev1sec3">
        sections 6.3
       </a>
       ,

       <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06lev1sec5">
        6.5
       </a>
       . Here are some questions you can focus on:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre16">
      </p>
      <ul class="calibre17">
       <li class="calibre18">
        Should you have a single WIP limit for the complete board? Why would that be good for you?
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        Can you start by limiting work in some columns? Which ones? Why?
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        If you limit work per person, what kind of behavior would that drive or give you?
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        Would swim lanes with WIP limits per lane help you in your situation?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="noind">
       If you donât know how to answer these questions, you should try something that seems appropriate, pay attention to what happens,
         and learn from that. When you come up with a good strategy and a number, start to discuss how this policy should be treated
         in your daily work:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre16">
      </p>
      <ul class="calibre17">
       <li class="calibre18">
        What kind of behavior are you encouraging by the way youâve set up your limit?
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        What should you do when you end up in a situation in which youâre breaking the WIP limit?
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        Should you count blocked/queued items against the limit?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="noind">
       As always, strive to start simple and make your approach more advanced as you see the need.

       6.8. Summary
      </h3>
      <p class="noind">
       In this chapter we talked about finding and visualizing good WIP limits:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre16">
      </p>
      <ul class="calibre17">
       <li class="calibre18">
        Thereâs no one right WIP limit for you and your team.
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        Limiting WIP isnât the goal; improving flow is. WIP limits are merely a tool that helps find problems that hinder a better
            flow.
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        A lower WIP limit will move your work faster and also bring problems to your attention more quickly. You want a low WIP limit,
            but not too low.
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        When setting out to find a WIP limit, start simpleâmaybe as simple as the slogan â
        <a class="calibre4" href="#ch06lev2sec4">
         Stop starting, start finishing
        </a>
        .â
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        You can limit the WIP for the whole team/workflow:
        <p class="calibre16">
        </p>
        <ul class="calibre30">
         <li class="calibre18">
          This approach can help you improve collaboration.
         </li>
         <li class="calibre18">
          It helps you keep focus on finishing work items before taking on new ones.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        You can limit WIP based on column:
        <p class="calibre16">
        </p>
        <ul class="calibre30">
         <li class="calibre18">
          This puts focus on flowing items through the workflow.
         </li>
         <li class="calibre18">
          It can help to manage bottlenecks.
         </li>
         <li class="calibre18">
          Maybe you already have a hunch about what you need to improve and can start limiting WIP for that column.
         </li>
         <li class="calibre18">
          Work can also be limited by estimated size (story points, for example).
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        You can limit WIP based on people:
        <p class="calibre16">
        </p>
        <ul class="calibre30">
         <li class="calibre18">
          Limiting the number of avatars that can be in play is one way to easily accomplish this.
         </li>
         <li class="calibre18">
          Using swim lanes is another.
         </li>
         <li class="calibre18">
          This can help you prevent too much multitasking and people being involved in every item on the board.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li class="calibre18">
        Most teams have a WIP limit on the work-item level, not the task level.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="noind">
       WIP limits are ways to improve the flow of your workflow, but what is that? Itâs one of the main concepts of Lean that we
         havenât yet talked about. And itâs the topic of the next chapter.
