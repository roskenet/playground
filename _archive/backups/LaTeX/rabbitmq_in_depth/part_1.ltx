\part{RabbitMQ and application architecture}

                     In this part of the book, we’ll explore the structure of the AMQ protocol, which is how your application communicates with         RabbitMQ. We’ll also look at the messages themselves, leveraging features such as message headers, priority, and more, to         enhance message interactions. We’ll explore performance trade-offs, balancing stability and transactional safety against high-performance         throughput with no guarantees. Additionally, we’ll investigate the different exchange types and why they work the way they         do.
