# Clean Code

Clean code is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It is well-structured, concise, and uses meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. It also follows best practices and design patterns and favors readability and behavior over performance and implementation details.

“What’s the one thing you can do, such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”
