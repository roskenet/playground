Pests also have their good sides

Bugs are annoying teachers. They bother, but they also reveal important information about the developer and the code. However, this only applies if one reflects on the bugs precisely.

-> Today, consider with every bug: What does it tell me about myself? What does it tell me about the code? What can I learn from it?
-> What types of bugs do you know? How can you classify bugs?
