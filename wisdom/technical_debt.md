# Technical Debt 

"One could even argue that a team that owns a code base with technical debt is not doing agile software development. Because, what's the opposite of agile? Rigid. If the code is riddled with code smells, then it can't be easily changed, so there's no way the team would be able to quickly react to changes in requirements and deliver continuously." - Clean Code in Python, 2nd ed.,
